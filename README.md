Supported PCI/USB device IDs (Linux)
====================================

Lists of PCI/USB device IDs supported by Linux:

* [Linux - PCI](/Linux/pci.ids.md)
* [Linux - USB](/Linux/usb.ids.md)

The data is compiled from the [list of supported devices](https://github.com/linuxhw/Drivers) and [pci.ids](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pciutils/pciids/master/pci.ids) / [usb.ids](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usbids/usbids/master/usb.ids).

The repository is needed to easily find support status for devices in Linux by their name.
